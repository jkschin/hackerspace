This was a really simple problem that got me stuck for a really really long
time. I was coding this in Python multiple times and kept getting a TLE but I
thought my algorithm was already in `O(n)`. I'm pretty sure it actually was. In
any case, I decided to switch to writing it in C++.

Admittedly, this is slightly different from what I wrote in Python, but it's
ultimately still `O(n)`. I might explore my Python solution some day in future
but not now.
